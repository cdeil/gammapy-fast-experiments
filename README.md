# gammapy-fast-experiments

A place to experiment with fast implementations of analyses like in Gammapy.

Really I just want to learn a bit how PyTorch and Tensorflow work,
using simple examples I know.

See if they are flexible / complete enough to do simple high-level
gamma-ray data analyses where I can implement my own model or likelihood.
